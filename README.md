# FMLearn
“**Federated Meta-Learning**” (FML), a concept that allows everyone to benefit from the data that is generated through software libraries including machine learning and data science libraries. 

We have built **FMLearn**, an application developed using the client-server model, to allows the exchange of meta-data about machine learning models for the purpose of meta-learned algorithm selection and configuration.

[scikit-learn](https://github.com/mukeshmk/scikit-learn) has been forked and a package has been developed in it to make API calls to **FMLearn**.

The use of **FMLearn** to identify the algorithm with the best performance, that is, least MSE for a dataset allows the user in scaling down the repetitive effort and time consumed in rewriting and executing code, correcting possible human errors, etc.
